Exercise 25 - Password Strength Indicator
Functions help you abstract away complex operations, but they also help you build reusable components.

Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:

A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.
Example Output
The password '12345' is a very weak password.
The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.
The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.
The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.
Constraints
Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument and returns
a value you can evaluate to determine the password strength.
Do not have the function return a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple languages in the future.
Use a single output statement.
